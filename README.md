I'm building [WeWrite App](https://x.com/WeWriteApp) which is GitHub for thought. GitHub for just regular writings, where your notes are [version-controlled](https://www.notion.so/wewrite-app/Version-history-filmstrip-b2e6d1ad3301468d955d037c673a0227). Similar to how you can sponsor a GitHub project, each page on WeWrite has a floating Donation Bar.
