I'm building [WeWrite App](https://x.com/WeWriteApp) which aims to become "GitHub for Thought." 

GitHub for just regular writings, where your notes are [version-controlled](https://www.notion.so/wewrite-app/Version-history-filmstrip-b2e6d1ad3301468d955d037c673a0227). 

Similar to how you can sponsor a GitHub project, each page on WeWrite has a floating [Donation Bar](https://wewrite-app.notion.site/Donation-bar-25b3fe60b7fe4eb0b6afe6da802a8906)

Please become a supporter today so we can accelerate development! https://opencollective.com/wewrite-app
